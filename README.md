A modern CCTV monitoring dashboard built with Next.js 15, featuring real-time incident management, advanced timeline visualization, and professional security monitoring capabilities.

## Features Implemented

- **Navbar**: Top navigation with MANDLACX branding and user profile
- **Interactive Timeline**: 5-minute precision timeline with playbook controls and scrollable interface
- **Incident Player**: Left panel with video player and camera thumbnails
- **Incident List**: Right panel with enhanced status indicators and overlapping visual elements
- **Real-time Updates**: SWR for data fetching with optimistic UI updates
- **Incident Management**: Mark incidents as resolved with instant UI feedback
- **Professional UI**: Dark theme with golden accents and enhanced visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for responsive layout across all devices

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom scrollbar hiding
- **Data Fetching**: SWR for client-side data management
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React hooks with optimistic updates

## Database Schema

- **Camera**: ID, name, location, created timestamp
- **Incident**: ID, camera relation, type, timestamps, thumbnail, resolved status

## Tech Decisions

### Framework Choice: Next.js 15
- **Rationale**: Latest App Router provides excellent TypeScript support and server-side rendering capabilities
- **Benefits**: Built-in API routes, automatic code splitting, and optimized performance
- **Trade-offs**: Bleeding edge version may have limited community resources for edge cases

### Database: SQLite with Prisma
- **Rationale**: Simple setup for development with type-safe database operations
- **Benefits**: Zero configuration, excellent TypeScript integration, easy migrations
- **Production Consideration**: Would recommend PostgreSQL for production deployment

### Styling: Tailwind CSS
- **Rationale**: Utility-first approach enables rapid prototyping and consistent design
- **Benefits**: Built-in responsive utilities, dark mode support, and custom color schemes
- **Implementation**: Custom scrollbar hiding across all browsers for clean UI

### State Management: SWR + React Hooks
- **Rationale**: Lightweight solution for data fetching with automatic revalidation
- **Benefits**: Built-in caching, optimistic updates, and error handling
- **Alternative Considered**: React Query (now TanStack Query) - SWR chosen for simplicity

### Timeline Implementation: SVG-based
- **Rationale**: Precise positioning and scalability for time-based visualization
- **Benefits**: 9000px width supports detailed 5-minute intervals with smooth scrolling
- **Performance**: Optimized with proper viewport management and sticky positioning
